# Wall Drawing #238 (1974)

The location of a parallelogram, a parallelogram whose top and bottom sides are two and a half times as long as its left and right sides and whose top side is located between the points where two sets of lines cross; the first line of the first set is drawn from a point halfway between the center of the wall and a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper left corner to a point halfway between the midpoint of the bottom side and the lower right corner, the second line of the first set from the midpoint of the top side to a point equidistant to the center of the wall, a point halfway between the center of the wall and the midpoint of the bottom side and a point halfway between the midpoint of the left side and the lower left corner. The first line of the second set is drawn from a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper right corner to the lower right corner. The second line of the second set is drawn from a point halfway between the midpoint of the right side and the upper right corner to a point halfway between a point halfway between the center of the wall and the upper left corner and a point halfway between the midpoint of the top side and the upper left corner. The left side is drawn on a line to a point halfway between the point where the second line of the first set of lines ends and a point halfway between the midpoint of the bottom side and the lower left corner.
