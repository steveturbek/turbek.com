# Scorbot Robot Controller

## Description

This is a messing around, learning project from getting a free robot arm. The Scorbot ER III is a circa 1995 robot. So simple, maybe even I can work with it!

The goals of the project are to

1. Learn
1. Restore the basic functionality of movement and encoders
1. Design and build an arduino based controller that accepts a joystick-type controller and data input to operate.
1. Design and build a case

## When might I quit this project?

- If motors, or encoders stop working
- If costs go above $200
- If effort goes beyond a few weeks

## Project Log

- August 2025
  - Got Scorbot ER III discarded by friends at NYC First. No controller or documentation
  - serial number 2090047 model "robot"
  - identified it as scorbot ER iii, found documentation and github projects.
  - Motors can be moved with basic 12v .5A power.
  - Gripper does not move, carefully opening it, seems like encoder case is bent, propellor hitting encoder and LEDs
  - Gripper microswitch is hanging off, which may be related.
  - I'm going to run motors on 12v power
  - all 5 microswitch work from switch leads and the pins
  - microswitch cam discs that trigger switches at home point are broken for shoulder, elbow, wrist. for shoulder, using broken pieces, looks like trigger radius is 30mm, clearance is 26-28mm. cup depth is 10mm, center hole dia is 6mm
  - Repaired the Gripper motor and the encoder, which was banged in. microswitch re-attached
  - gripper motor plate uses unusual 3.5mm hex for screws
  - using multimeter on Gripper and base, it seems motor encoders work!
  - Motors do NOT have auto stop switches at ends of rotation. assume they do it in software
  - cams are missing, but based on base, the 'home' position, where microswitch is, should be the center of movement.
  - confirmed Gripper encoder works, hand spinning disc. 47 ohm resistor works to LED. LED is infrared, not visible. photoresistor needs 10k pull up to 5v each to pin 0 and 1, where signal is read. (Arduino has this built in)
  - assuming other encoders work, proceeding with buying parts

## TODO

- check / set microswitches are in centerpoint of movement
- make replacement microswitch cams

## Project Parts List

- Scorbot ER iii robot arm, without controller or Teaching pendant (~$200-300)
- Arduino-type Mega board
- D-50 style connector

### Scorbot Cable connector

The Scorbot cable connector is an unusual [DB 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature) cable. Connectors and breakout boards that fit are available at Amazon or Ali Express. [DB 50 connector Specification](https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1656989.pdf)

Here is the pin numbers (looking at the scorbot cable connector pins)
